# Yet Another Minecraft!
===
This is a haskell clone of [Simple Minecraft-inspired program using Python and Pyglet](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) @[fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman)

If lucky enough then the `Main` binary can run directly on your MBP(El Capitan)

To compile and run the demo, do as follows

(`Just $ install dependencies >>= cabal install`)

```bash
ghc Main.hs
./Main
```

## TODO

ganna following @[fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman) to make a robust and featured runnable multiuser client over network
